# Changelog
## 0.2.0 on 2017-11-27
- changed signature for byWeb(), should not accept summary text.
- added "required" attribute when adding an "experience required" qualifcation().
This is the same as "yearsOfExperience", but that attribute has a misleading name,
referring not to how many years of experience the employer desires, but whether
experience is required (4) or not required (1).
- many changes and additions to the example scripts, including examples for
updating and deleting vacancies and the beginning of script that performs
Arbetsf√∂rmedling's API tests.

## 0.1.4 on 2017-11-02
- Did not increment version number in package.json before pushing last commit. Get more coffee.

## 0.1.3 on 2017-11-02
- Updated README and CHANGELOG from 0.1.2 were not saved before pusblishing.
No functional changes in this update, this just corrects the documentation.

## 0.1.2 on 2017-11-02
- When adding a qualifcation(), create the parent element if it does not exist.
Previously, calling qualification() without first calling qualificationsRequired()
or qualificationsRequiredSummary() would result in an error.
- Correct package name in tests.
- Move release notes from README to CHANGELOG.

## 0.1.1 on 2017-10-07
